# Introduction 
## Markdown

>Markdown is:
>   * a text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. 
    * a way to style text on the web.

I personally use it for making notes. You can include:

* plain text, with italic and bold 
* different level of headers
* links
* images
* blockquotes
* lists
* formatting paragraph
